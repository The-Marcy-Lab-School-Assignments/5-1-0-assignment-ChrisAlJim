# Question

What is the difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are created? What is the difference between how they are used?

# Answer

Class method/properties are made using the `static` keyword and belong to the class itself meaning they can only be accessed by the class itself and not the instance. Instance methods/properties do not use a keyword and are accessed by the instance.
